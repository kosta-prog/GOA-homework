# REMEMBER!

# > - greater than
# < - less than
# >= - greater than or equal to
# <= - less than or equal to
# == - equal to
# != - not equal to

#Example:

# x = 5
# y = 10
# print(x > y) # False
# print(x < y) # True
# print(x >= y) # False
# print(x <= y) # True
# print(x == y) # False
# print(x != y) # True

# CLasswork
print(True and False or False and False or True or True or False)

# the answer: True

# That is, first not happens, then and, finally or.
# That is, when Python executes the code, it will first "determine" and, and then or.
